Test code should instantiate an instance of the object and run its methods.

Code should be well planned before it is written.  Code should be compiled as frequently as possible in as many stages as possible.

Test code for DotComBust:

There are 4 methods in the DotComBust class:

    setUpGame()

    startPlaying()

    checkUserGuess()

    finishGame()

Each method should have it's own test program.

Each condition tested should have it's own test program.

To know what conditions to test, one should know what the method can do.

    setUpGame() does what:

        Creates Dot Coms.

        Gives locations to Dot Coms.

        Names the Dot Coms.

        Puts the Dot Coms in a list.

    setUpGame() conditions to test

        Can it create a Dot Com?

        Can it set the Dot Com's location(s)?

        Can it name the Dot Com?

        Can it add the Dot Com to an array list?

    startPlaying() does what:

        Checks if the list is empty.

        Prompts the user for a guess.

        Checks the guess is correct.

        Ends the game.

    startPlaying() conditions to test:

        Can it check the list?  Can it tell it is empty?

        Can it prompt the user for a guess?

        Can it check the guess is correct?

        Can it end the game?

    checkUserGuess(String userGuess) does what:

        Adds 1 to the number of guesses

        Checks the user's guess against the listed locations of the listed Dot Coms

        Prints the result of the user's guess

    checkUserGuess(String userGuess) conditions to test:

        Can it add 1 to the number of guesses?

        Can it check the user's guess using the Dot Com's checkYourself() method?

        Can it print the result?

    finishGame() does what:

        Prints the final game result

    finishGame conditions to test:

        Can it Print the final result?
