    <p>
        These are some common issues that you should be aware of. If you're having trouble, you may want to look through these to see
        if any apply to you or may be the source of your problem.
    </p>

    <a name="annotations"></a>
    <h4>Annotations aren't saved when running locally in Mozilla Firefox</h4>

    <p>
        The solution here is to run the graphs using a web server. At this time (March 2010) only Safari, Chrome and Opera
        support saving annotations when running locally.
    </p>

    <a name="missing.text"></a>
    <h4>Missing text in Google Chrome</h4>

    <p>
        Since one of the Chrome 4 dev releases there has been an issue with Google Chrome 4 and 5, asynchronous processing and  not rendering
        graph labels. This has been remedied by simply not using asynchronous processing. Because of the tag placement on the front page,
        the effect shouldn't be apparent. Other browsers (eg Firefox, Safari, Opera, MSIE) are fine.
    </p>

    <a name="firefox.tooltips.clipboard"></a>
    <h4>Firefox, tooltips and the clipboard</h4>

    <p>
        Firefox, tooltips and using the clipboard is a little convoluted. To copy the text in a tooltip you must do the following:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li style="margin-top: 0">Select the text you want with the mouse.</li>
        <li style="margin-top: 0">Press CTRL+C (it may be a different key combination if you're not using Windows) to copy the text to the clipboard.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Shadows in Google Chrome 6 and the line chart</h4>

    <p>
        At the moment (28th August 2010) shadows in Google Chrome 6 are somewhat broken. Currently Google Chrome 6 is available
        on the dev and beta channels. Firefox, MSIE, Opera and Safari are fine. The reason for this
        error is a combination of factors it seems - shadow blurring and line width. A fix has been added to allow shadow blurring,
        but you will still need to increase your charts line width.
