                 o HProgress
                 o VProgress

                +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  o [17-07-2010] Stepped line charts and their tickmarks have been marginally altered. No final tickmark is now shown (it looks
                 odd being isolated)
  o [17-07-2010] Changed the Odo chart.needle.style to chart.needle.color
  o [17-07-2010] The Odo properties chart.start, chart.end and chart.value have all been changed to internal properties:
                 obj.start, obj.end and obj.value
  o [09-07-2010] With the Odometer the old property chart.needle.style has been renamed to be chart.needle.color
  o [09-07-2010] The Progress bar has had it's properties chart.max and chart.value changed to class properties, this means
                 that if you want to make use of these, you will now need to use myProgress.value and myProgress.max.
                 myProgress being the name of your graph object.

 o [01-05-2010] The Donut chart is now a variant of the Pie chart (chart.variant = donut)
 o [24-04-2010] The radar chart has been renamed to Rose. The library is now called RGraph.rose.js and the constructor has
                been renamed. It has also been prettied up marginally and labels have been added.

 o [17-04-2010] Default chart.tooltips bar chart property has changed from an empty array to null.
 o [17-04-2010] The RGraph.common.js library has now been split into 5 separate files because it had
                become far too large. You can read the new implementation details here:
                http://www.rgraph.net/docs/index.html#implementation
 o [10-04-2010] The "coords" arrays (for each object) have been unified. Now you no longer need to take
                into account the margins. What you get in the coords arrays are as they are used on the
                graph.
