Implement a ContentProvider

This is an attempt to build the skeletal ContentProvider info from 
http://androidcookbook.com/Recipe.seam?recipeId=1558
into a compilable, complete, working program.

The UI was provided by the Android New Project wizard by
selecting "List-Detail" for the type of application.

STATUS - 
	INCOMPLETE - It compiles and runs, and the ContentProvider works
	The UI does not display the list from the CP correctly (blanks) and the detail
	shows a faked-up item, not the corresponding one from the CP.
