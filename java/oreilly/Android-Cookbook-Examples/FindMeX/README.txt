Find Me X

The production version of this Android application will take a query of the form: 

find me <placetype> in <locality>, <city>

and returns a list of places of that type in the specified locality sorted by their distance from you.

However the current version has a hard-coded location, as it is indended to illustrate the
"mocking locations" recipe.
