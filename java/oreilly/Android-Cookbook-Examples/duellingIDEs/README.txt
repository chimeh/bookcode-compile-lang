This is some support for opening an Eclipse ADT/AndMore project in Android Studio.

USE AT OWN RISK, and make a backup of your project first!

Look at the add-gradle-to-eclipse script to see how to use it.

The name is a pun on "Duelling Banjos" (look that up if you're too young to remember it)
and "dualling" (making dual-access to two IDEs).
