Contact picker with autocomplete

This allows you to search for an email address either by name or by email address,
and feeds that to an AutoCompleteTextView.

It works adequately, except that in portrait mode, the matched-so-far selections appear to
be about 10 lines long (hundreds of spaces at the end). If you find a way around this,
please let me know!
