Hello Maven?
============

Although the point of this exercise is to give you practice running archetype:generate,
for the benefit of the terminally impatient, we are providing a copy of the generated
project, with the Eclipse files added, in case you'd rather start by copying a full
working project than generate it using Maven. It's basically just the standard Hello
World project, with a Maven-style directory structures (src/main/java instead of src/),
and a pom.xml file so you can built it with Maven.
