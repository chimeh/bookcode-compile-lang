The main code is from the "Sliding Drawer - Top Down" recipe 
contributed by Wagied Davids to the Android Cookbook. The Panel and
easing/*Interpolator stuff was taken from a different project on Wagied's
web site, TestSlidingDrawer.

Some of the graphic elements were taken from the http://smart-timetable.googlecode.com/
"Smart Timetable" googlecode project, and are copyright, and ASL-2 licensed, by Google Inc.
