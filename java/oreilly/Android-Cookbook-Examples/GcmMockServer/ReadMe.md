GcmMockServer
=============

This standalone Java program works with the Google Cloud Messaging service and the simple GCM client
defined in [../GcmClient](https://github.com/AndroidCook/Android-Cookbook-Examples/tree/master/GcmClient). 
You really need to read the Android Cookbook recipe at
https://androidcookbook.com/Recipe.seam?recipeId=4601 to figure out all the moving pieces!
