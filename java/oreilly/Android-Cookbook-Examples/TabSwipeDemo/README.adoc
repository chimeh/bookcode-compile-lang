== TabSwipeDemo

This example shows an ActionBar with multiple Tabs, all embedded in a
ViewPager so the user can either swipe among the tabs OR (if they're
old school) tab the tab icons in the ActionBar.

There is also a menu but it doesn't do anything yet; see the
PreferencesDemo project for the most common use of a Menu.
