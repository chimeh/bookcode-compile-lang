== DataToCursor

A tiny demo of using some existing data to fake up a Cursor 
whose rows contain the filename and filetype.

This is in answer to a http://learningtree.com/2771/[Learning Tree Course 2771] attendee who asked
how to make up a Cursor from files when using
a non-SQL-based ContentProvider.
