/**
 * <p>{@link InferenceRule} provides the basic mechanism to extract new
 * knowledge from already existing rules inside the triple store. It 
 * therefore provides two methods:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getQueries()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #makeTriples(Map)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The first method defines the queries which are needed to extract new knowledge, 
 * while the latter one defines new rules which get added to the knowledge base</p>
 * 
 * <p>A typical example of inferencing is the membership of a person to a 
 * certain country and the continent. The knowledge base for example may contain 
 * a rule that Peter is German, Sandra is Austrian and Paul is US citizen. Based 
 * on the knowledge of the belonging from a person to a certain state some further
 * rules can be derived. As Germany and Austria are located in Europe and USA 
 * in Northern America, Peter and Sandra may be considered as European while
 * Paul is (North) American.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Imagine the triplestore contains the following knowledge:</p>
 * <code>[(Paul, nationality, USA), (USA, part_of, North America), 
 * (Peter, nationality, Germany), (Austria, part_of, Europe), 
 * (Germany, part_of, Europe), (Sandra, nationality, Austria)]</code>
 * <p>With an implementation of {@link #getQueries()} as follows all persons that
 * live in a country and the country is part of a continent should be considered for
 * the inferencing algorithm.</p>
 * <pre> {@code public Set<Set<String>> getQueries() 
 * {
 *    {@code Set<Set<String>> query = new LinkedHashSet<Set<String>>();}
 *    {@code Set<String> query1 = new LinkedHashSet<String>();}
 *    {@code query1.add("?person, nationality, ?country");}
 *    {@code query1.add("?country, part_of, ?continent");}
 *     
 *    {@code query.add(query1);}
 *    {@code return query;}
 * }</pre>
 * <p>{@link #makeTriples(Map)} defines how the new rules are added to the knowledge 
 * base.</p>
 * <pre> {@code public Set<Triple> makeTriples(Map<String, String> binding) 
 * {
 *    {@code Triple t = new Triple(binding.get("?person") ,"on_continent", binding.get("?continent"));}
 *    {@code Set<Triple> ret = new LinkedHashSet<Triple>();}
 *    {@code ret.add(t);}
 *    {@code return ret;}
 * }</pre>
 * <p>On adding the {@link InferenceRule} to via {@link Graph#applyInference(InferenceRule)} 
 * to the knowledge base the inferencing process starts. After the inferencing mechanism the 
 * knowledge base contains looks like this:</p>
 * <code>[(Paul, on_continent, North America), (Paul, nationality, USA), 
 * (USA, part_of, North America), (Peter, on_continent, Europe), (Peter, nationality, Germany), 
 * (Austria, part_of, Europe), (Germany, part_of, Europe), (Sandra, on_continent, Europe), 
 * (Sandra, nationality, Austria)]</code>
