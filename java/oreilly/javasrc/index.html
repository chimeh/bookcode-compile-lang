<h1>Ian Darwin's Java Cookbook: Source Code</h1>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>This distribution is for the Second Edition of the book;
files here <b>do not match the First Edition of the Java Cookbook</b>.
If you want files for the first edition of the book, try
<a href="http://javacook.darwinsys.com/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>What's here..</h3>
<p>All the important source code files from
<a href="http://javacook.darwinsys.com/">The Java Cookbook</a>
(plus quite a number that are not covered in the book) are here.
Most of these files are Java source code.</p>
<p>For the few that are Applets,
if you load the Applet's HTML file from here, the applet will not run.
The HTML files must be saved to disk and the applets compiled,
before you can run them.
</p>
<p>All files are Copyright &copy;.
See the accompanying <a href="LICENSE">Legal Notice</a> for conditions of use.
You can pretty much do what you want with these, including using
them commercially, under the terms of the original
<a href="LICENSE">Berkeley Copyright</a>,
which has been approved as an
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>
conditions-of-use.

<h3>Where is...?</h3>
<p>Most of the questions people ask relate to the other APIs that I
have used in the book. The following table will help you resolve
missing classes. Remember that, as discussed in Section 2.5, you
need to have these in your class path both at compile time and
at run time.</p>
