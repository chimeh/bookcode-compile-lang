<h1>Java RegExp Examples</h1>
<p>These programs were originally based on the Java Cookbook,
Chapter 4, Regular Expressions.
They have been updated for JDK1.5+.
Some of the early demos were presented as part of my
Javopolis 2002 presentation (November 2002, Antwerp).
(As of 2008, Javopolis has been re-named to
<a href="http://www.devoxx.com">Devoxx</a> for some reason).
