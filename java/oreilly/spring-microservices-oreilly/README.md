# Spring Microservices
My labs and notes from Oreilly's course on Spring Microservices using Netflix's OSS. This course covered the following technologies:

* Microservices configuration Server
* Eureka Discovery Server
* Eureka Discovery Client
* Hystrix (circuit breaking)
* Ribbon (load balancer)
* Zuul (reverse proxy for microservices)
* Oauth2 Authentication Server (using Spring Security Oauth)
* Oauth2 Resource Server
* Oauth2 Client
