# Functional Thinking
Learning the syntax of a new language is easy, but learning to think under a different paradigm is difficult. This video from renowned software architect Neal Ford helps you transition from a Java-writing imperative programmer to a functional programmer, using Java, Clojure and Scala as examples.

Rather than focus on specific language features, Functional Thinking looks at a variety of common practices in OOP languages and then shows you how to solve the same problems using a functional language. For instance, you know how to achieve code-reuse in Java via mechanisms such as inheritance and polymorphism. Code reuse is also possible in functional languages, using high-order functions, composition, and multi-methods.

Ford encourages you to value results over steps, so you can begin to
think like a functional programmer. Expect your mind to be bent, but
youâ€™ll finish with a much better understanding of both the syntax and
semantics of functional languages. This video is ideal for any
experienced programmer.
