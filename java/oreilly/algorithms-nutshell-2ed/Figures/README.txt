Information showing how to generate many of the figures in the book can be
found in the respective sub-directories for each chapter:

  Chapter1    No computed images
  Chapter2    1 hour, 3 minute
  Chapter3    1 minute
  Chapter4    1 hour, 34 minutes

installed. If you only have Python 2.x then some figures might not generate
properly.

In Chapter 11, figure 10-12 and 11-2 use gnuplot features not available in
version 4.0, but which are available in 4.6.
