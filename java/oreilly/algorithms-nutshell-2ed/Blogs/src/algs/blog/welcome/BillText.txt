ards required under this subsection shall be effective 12

holds an equity or debt position in the financial in- 14
stitution. 15
(2) CRITERIA.-The standards required under 16
this subsection shall include- 17
(A) limits on compensation that exclude in- 18
centives for senior executive officers of a finan- 19
cial institution to take unnecessary and exces- 20
sive risks that threaten the value of the finan- 21
cial institution during the period that the Sec- 22
retary holds an equity or debt position in the fi- 23
nancial institution; 24
32

to be disclosed pursuant to the Securities Exchange 16

and non-public company counterparts. 18
(c) AUCTION PURCHASES.-Where the Secretary de- 19
termines that the purposes of this Act are best met 20
through auction purchases of troubled assets, and only 21
where such purchases per financial institution in the ag- 22
gregate exceed $300,000,000 (including direct purchases), 23
the Secretary shall prohibit, for such financial institution, 24
any new employment contract with a senior executive offi- 25

eign financial authorities or banks hold troubled assets as 17

that have failed or defaulted on such financing, such trou- 19
bled assets qualify for purchase under section 101. 20

ing such assets, in order to maximize the value 15

terms as will compensate the Secretary with 23
equivalent value, in the event that a sufficient 24
39

shareholder vote to authorize the necessary ad- 1
ditional shares cannot be obtained. 2
(3) EXCEPTIONS.- 3
(A) DE MINIMIS.-The Secretary shall es- 4
