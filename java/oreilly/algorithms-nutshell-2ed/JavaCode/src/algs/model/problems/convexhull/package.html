Defines core classes for the Convex Hull problem.

Given a set of points P in a two-dimensional plane, the convex hull is 
the smallest convex shape that fully encloses all points in P. The hull 
is convex because a line between any 2 points within it lies totally 
within the hull. 

The convex hull computation is specified by the following API description:

<pre>
public interface IConvexHull {
   /**
    * Return the computed convex hull for the input set of IPoint objects.
    * 
    * Points must have at least three points to do anything meaningful. If
    * it does not, then the sorted array is returned as the "hull".
    * 
    * Some implementations may be able to work if duplicate points are found,
    * but the set should contain distinct IPoint objects.
    *
    * @param points     a set of (n &ge; 3) two dimensional points.
    */
    public IPoint[] compute (IPoint[] points);
}
</pre>

The hull is formed by a clockwise ordering of h points L<sub>0</sub> … L<sub>h–1</sub>. The first point
L<sub>0</sub> is typically the leftmost point in the set P (although any point can be the
start). Each sequence of three hull points L<sub>i</sub>, L<sub>i+1</sub>, L<sub>i+2</sub> creates
a right turn; note that this property holds for L<sub>h–2</sub>, L<sub>h–1</sub>, L<sub>0</sub> as well.
