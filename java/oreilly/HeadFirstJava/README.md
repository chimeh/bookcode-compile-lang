Introduction
============
I am starting a git repository as a learn Java with O'Reilly's _[Head First Java 2nd Edition](http://amzn.com/0596009208)_. This is an attempt to record my learning progress more accurately and clearly.

Why Java?
---------
Simply because it's the programming language tested on AP Computer Science.  
Frankly, I find it more verbose than other languages.

Learning Enviornment
--------------------

I will use:  

* BlueJ
	* a simplified IDE, or whatever you call it, I'm not sure
* Terminal
	* I'll try replace the Finder with this as much as I can for file management.  
	I guess I'll use lots of simple bash commands, such as `ls`, `mkdir`, `cd` and stuff like that. Zed Shaw has a [nice introduction](http://www.learncodethehardway.org/) to bash commands.) Of course, I'll be using Git as well, which I learned from [GitImmersion](http://www.gitimmersion.com/) and GitHub's quick tutorials.

###Computer Specs

I have a MacBook Pro 15 inch. But to increase my prductivity, I'll try to get a second display as well. Avatron Software's [Air Display](http://avatron.com/) seems like a nice way to turn my parent's older MBP into a more practical use.
